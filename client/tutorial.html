            <div class="piece-info">

                    <img src="assets/textures/light_pegasus.png" alt="">
                    <img src="assets/textures/dark_pegasus.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Pegasus</h3>
                    <p>The Pegasus moves like a Knight but can jump over obstacles like walls. This makes it excellent for navigating through difficult terrain.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="piece-card">
                    <img src="assets/textures/dark_medusa.png" alt="">
                    <img src="assets/textures/light_medusa.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Gorgon</h3>
                    <p>The Gorgon has limited movement (2 squares diagonally or orthogonally), but when it captures a piece, all adjacent pieces are stunned for 2 turns!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="piece-card">
                    <img src="assets/textures/dark_lion_chimera.png" alt="">
                    <img src="assets/textures/dark_goat_chimera.png" alt="">
                    <img src="assets/textures/light_goat_chimera.png" alt="">
                    <img src="assets/textures/light_lion_chimera.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Chimera (Lion and Goat)</h3>
                    <p>The Chimera Lion combines the power of the Queen with some Knight-like moves, making it an extremely versatile attacker.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="piece-card">
                    <img src="assets/textures/light_juggernaut.png" alt="">
                    <img src="assets/textures/dark_juggernaut.png" alt="">
                    <h3>Juggernaut</h3>
                    <p>The Lion moves like a Knight, while the Goat moves like a Bishop (limited to 2 squares). They must alternate turns and can move independently but stay within 5-6 tiles. When fully stretched with up to two enemy pieces between them, they snap back, capturing those pieces. If one half is captured, so is the other.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="piece-card">
                    <h3>Builder</h3>
                        <img src="assets/textures/dark_builder.png" alt="">
                        <img src="assets/textures/light_builder.png" alt="">
                    <p>The Builder can create and remove walls. First move the Builder, then click on an empty square to place a wall or click on an existing wall to remove it.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <h2>Obstacles</h2>
            <p><strong>Walls:</strong> Walls block movement for most pieces. Only the Pegasus can jump over them, and the Juggernaut can break through them.</p>
            <p><strong>Mud:</strong> When a piece lands on mud, it must stop its movement. On the next turn, it can move normally. The Juggernaut can move through mud without stopping.</p>
